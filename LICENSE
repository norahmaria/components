GNU General Public License (GPL): https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License

- A copy of the source code or written instructions about how to get a copy must be included with the software. If the software is able to be downloaded from the internet, the source code must also be available for downloading.
- The license of the software can not be changed or removed. It must always use the GPL.

In simple terms: You're free to modify, redestribute and sell as long as your project is open source, and keeps the same license.

If the user does not agree to follow the GPL, they can still use the software under copyright laws. They can use it and make copies or changes to it for themselves, but they cannot give it away or sell it. They also can not change the license.
