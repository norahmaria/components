@category Stories:
  ☐ Replace the 'Show Code' under doc pages
  ☐ Figure out how to add argTypes for subcomponents
  ☐ Add overview of the classNames in the components


@category Issues: @critical
  ☐ You provided a 'checked' prop to a form field without an 'onChange' handler, this will render read-only (radio buttons, default checked)


@category Components:
  ☐ Allow to add classNames, and inline styles
  ☐ Allow default values for inputs @high
  ☐ Add a span size option for text input and select component
  ☐ Add event as additional args for onChange functions
  
  Switch: 
    ☐ Add hover effect @moderate
    ☐ Make sure it sticks to its container (margin-top is minus so its eh)

  Radio:
    ☐ Mouse consistency (hover isn't always showing correct mouse)
    ☐ Add dynamic ids for buttons based on name
    ☐ Disabled radio buttons look checked

  Select:
    ☐ Add Select keyboard navigation (up and down keys) @critical
    ☐ Add more spacing on top of first groups
    ☐ Select disabled not working properly @critical
    ☐ Option disabled _and_ selected not looking good

  Text Input:
    ☐ Add view password option @future
    ☐ Figure out why testing for characterLimit set to 4 is unsolvable @low
    ☐ Consider not using native input directly (pros / cons, maybe a hidden one as with checkboxes etc) @future

  Button: 
    ☐ Type of button


@category Structure:
  ☐ Add a global SCSS file user should import to avoid repetitive code for resets etc.
  ☐ Consider mixins for basic border with box shadow hover/focus etc.
  ☐ Consistent onChange naming convention, *if* that does not override my onChange fns


@category Tools:
  useForm hook:
    ☐ Add base functionality
    ☐ Make id/name consistent in components for easy usage


@category Design:
  ☐ Re-think disabled / neutral schemes, they look a bit _too_ similar
  ☐ Consistency between Select and TextInput (color, height, text) @high

  
@category Testing:
  ☐ Add Text Input testing
