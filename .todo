Stories:
  ☐ Replace the 'Show Code' under doc pages
  ☐ Figure out how to add argTypes for subcomponents
  ☐ Add overview of the classNames in the components

Issues: @critical
  ☐ You provided a 'checked' prop to a form field without an 'onChange' handler, this will render read-only (radio buttons, default checked)

@NEXT Components:
  ☐ Slider
  ☐ Upload Button

Components:
  ☐ Add consitent click effect
  ☐ Mouse consistency (hover isn't always showing correct mouse)
  ☐ Allow to add classNames, and inline styles
  ☐ Consider if you should extend existing props (accessibility in mind)
  ☐ Allow default values for inputs @high
  ☐ Add event as additional args for onChange functions
  ☐ Icon for text / select is yellow / red when it has status even when disabled
  
  Switch: 
    ✔ Add hover effect @moderate @done(22-04-19 19:08)
    ✔ Add tabIndex and focus state @done(22-04-19 19:08)
    
  Radio:
    ☐ Add dynamic ids for buttons based on name
    ☐ Disabled radio buttons look checked
      
  Select:
    ☐ Font weight for disabled is too thick (Mozilla Firefox)
    ☐ Add Select keyboard navigation (up and down keys) @critical
    ☐ Add more spacing on top of first groups
    ☐ Select disabled not working properly @critical
    ☐ Option disabled _and_ selected not looking good

  Text Input:
    ☐ Consider not using native input directly (pros / cons, maybe a hidden one as with checkboxes etc) @future
    
  Button: 
    ☐ Type of button
    ☐ More size or at least weight to the font (does not stand out in a form lol)

Structure:
  ☐ Consistent onChange naming convention, *if* that does not override my onChange fns

Tools:
  useForm hook:
    ☐ Add base functionality
    ☐ Make id/name consistent in components for easy usage

Design:
  ☐ Re-think disabled / neutral schemes, they look a bit _too_ similar
  
Testing:
  ☐ Add Switch testing
