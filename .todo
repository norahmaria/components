Stories:
  ☐ Replace the 'Show Code' under doc pages
  ☐ Figure out how to add argTypes for subcomponents
  ☐ ~There is still some blue colors theme can't control~
  ☐ Add overview of the classNames in the components

Components:
  ☐ Allow to add classNames, and inline styles
  ☐ Allow default values for inputs
  ☐ Add a span size option for text input and select component
  ☐ Consistent onChange naming convention, *if* that does not override my onChange fns
  ☐ Add event as additional args for onChange functions
  ☐ Add dynamic ids for radio buttons based on name @idea
  ☐ Add hover effect for Switch component @high
  ☐ Button type (submit etc)
  ☐ Make sure switch components sticks to its container (margin-top is minus so its eh)
  
  ☐ Consistency between Select and TextInput (color, height, text) @high

  Radio:
    ☐ Mouse consistency (hover isn't always showing correct mouse)

  Select:
    ☐ Add Select keyboard navigation (up and down keys) @critical
    ☐ Add more spacing on top of first groups
    ☐ Select disabled not working properly @critical
    ☐ Option disabled _and_ selected not looking good

  Text Input:
    ✔ Add textarea @done(22-04-16 20:10)
    ✔ Add clear button @done(22-04-15 09:03)
    ✔ Design / space for character count @done(22-04-15 09:03)
    ☐ Add view password option @longterm
    ☐ Figure out why testing for characterLimit set to 4 is unsolvable @low
    ☐ Consider not using native input directly (pros / cons, maybe a hidden one as with checkboxes etc) @longterm

Structure:
  ☐ Add a global SCSS file user should import to avoid repetitive code for resets etc.
  ☐ Consider mixins for basic border with box shadow hover/focus etc.
  
  Design:
    ☐ Re-think disabled / neutral schemes, they look a bit _too_ similar
    
  Tools:
    useForm hook:
      ☐ Add base functionality
      ☐ Make id/name consistent in components for easy usage

Issues: @critical
  ☐ You provided a 'checked' prop to a form field without an 'onChange' handler, this will render read-only (radio buttons, default checked)
  ✔ Select z-index @done(22-04-13 08:35)

Testing:
  ☐ Add Text Input testing
  ✔ Add Radio testing @done(22-04-13 08:32)
